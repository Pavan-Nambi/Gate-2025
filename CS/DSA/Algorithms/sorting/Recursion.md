ah well so the recurssion, -  most real life programming concept i can think of 

go to heading recursion computer science 
real life? recursion? wtf r u talkin abt ?

Taking care of urself and ur mental state as u realised there is no one else that does that.. - in a way this can be called recursion

Talking to urself - recursion

Laughing and calling urself a fking asshole n saying u should just die - recursrion


Sure recursions applications goes way beyond this stupid analogies but idk hw to explain it more betterly lol

well.. nw  i think u understand y recursion is labelled hard? coz even in real life its hard.. to self reflect while staring at ur soul...

recursion is like ur ex..
who always reminds u, u shud have done better.
base point can be considered as u gettin over frm ur breakup

## ok enough of this bullshit 

recursion - function calling tiself

break the current problem into sub-problem. 
keep breaking the sub-problem until we reach a sub-problem with ans we alrdy kn.. or say solvable

tho in real development ppl tend to avoid recursion  based solutions.


but ha whatever we might need in somesituations n its good for somethings

WILL UPDATE THIS WITH MORE INFO AND MORE DEPTH LATER
